# XSCM
XSCM is a free Supply Chain Management with a greedy algorithm.
Supply chain management is a very important thing for many companies in the modern delivery age, however optimized routes are not always used. This can lead to increased transportation costs and less profit for the company. To solve this issue, a program can be created to optimize the route taken for deliveries. By inputting data such as the location of warehouses, the delivery locations, and the types of products being transported, the program can calculate the most efficient route to take. This can not only save on transportation costs but also improve the overall customer experience by reducing lead times. Ultimately, an optimized supply chain can lead to increased profits for the company.
